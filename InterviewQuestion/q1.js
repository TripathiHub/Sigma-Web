// The Magical Sorting Hat: Imagine you are creating a magical sorting hat for a wizard school.

// one of the four houses (Gryffindor (length less than 6), Hufflepuff(length less than 8),
// Ravenclaw(length less than 12), or Slytherin(length greater than or equal to 12)) based
// on the length of their names.
